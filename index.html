		<h3><center> A Poem By Our Founder </center></h3>
			<p><center> My first name is Lise-Farah.
			Two first names for one so yeah you would correct to assume that I am extra
			I never understood the beauty of my name until I embraced the beauty of me
			See I believe that everyone’s name tells a story without them even knowing
			Because I believe that no one is an accident
			Born with a purpose so deeply rooted inside the spirit that is you, so indestructible, so you
			Lise comes from the name Elizabeth, which means God’s chosen one
			Elizabeth was the mother of John the Baptist. See I come from a line of women chosen for the glory of God
			A lineage of people who can testify that when man says no, God is just beginning to carve a yes, a trinity of hope into your situation
			It is the name for queens, royalty
			Farah means joy, happiness, even traveler in some languages
			That explains my desire to travel the world and paint it all things true, and love
			Call me foolish or a dreamer
			But there is joy and happiness in the darkest of things
			I make my art there, I am fire burned and reshaped into the being that I am in that darkness
			Darkness is light hiding but its there,  thats the beauty of it
			Lise-Farah is a witness, a storyteller to a world that is not her home
			So I paint pictures with pain and love and love and pain
			I paint canvas with words of triumph and victory
			I believe in love
			I believe that love can make Lazarus of any tortured soul
			Can part the seas of darkness and light
			Confusion and doubt
			Insecurity and self worth
			I believe that love is an anchor
			A seed
			Life
			It was love that created me and you
			Love that made crucifixion worth it
			So I know how to say love in three different languages Father Son Spirit
			Wait, no
			Love, Amour, Amoue cheri
			I have loved someone past their audacity to valet park my heart, make a joke of my tears, and a doormat to insecurities I could pray he would conquer
			I have loved the stubbornness out of a woman who struggled to love past her pain
			I have loved myself out the lion’s den of depression
			My name means joy
			My name carries a weight on your tongue, is reality hard pressed against your chest
			Makes you believe in life and God again
			All things spiritual
			Say it right
			My name is Lise-Farah
			I am a witness. A poet. A story teller. But if you remember nothing
			Remember this
			My name is hope, joy,
			My name is all things chosen
			Worthy
			God
